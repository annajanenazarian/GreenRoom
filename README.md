# GreenRoom

The aim of this project is to create an automation system to control the temperature, light, water, and security in his plant room. The system will monitor the temperature and adjust it using a DC operated fan and alarm in case of overheating. It will also automatically adjust the light levels according to available light to save energy, control the watering system for the plants, and detect the entry of Chadi's dog and sound an alarm to scare it away. Additionally, we designed an AC to DC converter to power the system due to a shortage of battery supply in Chadi's area. 





This project was completed as part of the ELE402 - Electronics Lab. 

In collaboration with Mark Farah, Caren Youssef & Tracy El Ashkar.
